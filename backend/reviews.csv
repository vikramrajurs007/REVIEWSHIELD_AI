Personal Care,Vaseline Intensive Care Aloe Soothe Body Lotion 400ml,1/28/2019,5,Skin so soft.. highly recommend!,So prior to receiving this I had pretty rough elbows in particular and my skin feels dry. As a busy mum of two I admit I sometimes neglect myself.. some of you may empathise! But this product trial gave me the perfect opportunity to reconnect with myself and have a bit of \u201Cme time\u201D. So for 3 days after my baths / shower I smothered myself with this. I must admit the first time I put this on I wasn\u2019t sure about the smell. It\u2019s not offensive it\u2019s like a cucumber smell (although it\u2019s aloe) but I tend to smell of perfumes all the time.. however by day 3 I actually liked the smell. Application: it went on nicely not too thick and soaked in pretty quickly it didn\u2019t feel sticky. I always have my morning wash by 07:30 but even in the evening before bedtime my skin is feeling noticibly softer and my rough elbows gone. Verdict: thumbs up. Yes I will be continuing to use this thank you for a fab product trial and for introducing me to Vaseline Aloe!

Personal Care,Vaseline Intensive Care Aloe Soothe Body Lotion 400ml,1/28/2019,5,Skin so soft.. highly recommend!,So prior to receiving this I had pretty rough elbows in particular and my skin feels dry. As a busy mum of two I admit I sometimes neglect myself.. some of you may empathise! But this product trial gave me the perfect opportunity to reconnect with myself and have a bit of \u201Cme time\u201D. So for 3 days after my baths / shower I smothered myself with this. I must admit the first time I put this on I wasn't sure about the smell. It's not offensive it's like a cucumber smell (although it's aloe) but I tend to smell of perfumes all the time.. however by day 3 I actually liked the smell. Application: it went on nicely not too thick and soaked in pretty quickly it didn't feel sticky. I always have my morning wash by 07:30 but even in the evening before bedtime my skin is feeling noticibly softer and my rough elbows gone. Verdict: thumbs up. Yes I will be continuing to use this thank you for a fab product trial and for introducing me to Vaseline Aloe!

Homecare,"Persil Powercaps Non Bio Washing Capsules 50 Wash, 1350g",3/5/2019,5,Extremely good value Persil washing capsules,"Some things in life are enjoyable to buy and some things plainly are not. No matter how pretty the product and how bright and bold the actual washing detergent is, it will always be a grudge purchase. No one likes to have dirty smelly clothes and wash powder / tablets / capsules are a necessity that makes a hole in everyone's weekly grocery budget that could be better spent on something interesting such as cakes or exotic vegetables that you have to look up how to cook. Along with Ariel, Fairy and Bold, Persil is one of the big brands that dominant the market for detergents. It is owned by global consumer products giant Unilever who are experts at branding and marketing. It is refreshing to see these capsules at such reasonable value., they work out 15p each which is an absolute bargain. Even the dodgy imitation ones you find in sub prime supermarkets are more than these, and the great thing about Persil is that you can guarantee that the product is going to be high quality. These capsules come in a rubbery gossamer coated casing containing a different brightly coloured gel like liquids in each of the four compartments. And very funky they look too with purple, green, white and grey swirls of gu. These things wash your clothes nicely too and have a pleasant smell without being too overbearing. I have no idea what happens to the plasticated casing on the outside of the capsule after you put in in the washing machine. Maybe it bio-de-grades, maybe it disappears by magic, this is one of lives great mysteries like the Great Sphinx at Giza, the Bermuda Triangle or the meaning of the Voynich Manuscript.",True,0.9919,310,0.02846739715264284,0.4920634920634921,Fake

Homecare,Persil & Comfort New Baby Essential Laundry Kit(3 Items),4/26/2019,4,Persil and Comfort Sensitive Kit,"In this ""kit"" for sensitive skin you get x2 Persil non-biological washing detergent (potentially 48 washes) and x1 ultra-concentrate Comfort Pure (potentially 38 washes). I say potentially because if you are doing larger loads you'll need to increase the amount you use. We tend to alternate between Fairy and Persil non-bio, not only because we have young children but also because some family members have sensitive skin. We've never had an issue with someone having a reaction due to Persil, it's probably our preferred brand. We don't use Comfort Pure all the time because some members of the family don't like how it leaves their clothes feeling (too soft!), but we do use it on the children's clothes because it leaves them nice and soft. Both products in this kit are endorsed by the British Skin Foundation. Price for the kit at the time of writing the review is £11, this is slightly more than you would currently get the individual products in some supermarkets (£3 for each product). But you are getting them delivered too. If you wanted to give a practical baby shower gift, this would be ideal, slightly different to a nappy pyramid. Would also make a practical house-warming present. Overall - good products that work, slightly on the expensive side.",False,0.9736,249,0.034317646001868346,0.7142857142857144,Fake

Note that the container is made from 100% recycled plastic and is suitable for further recycling, but you do need to remove the plastic wrap that holds the product information (once the bottle is used up, as you need it beforehand for dosing information). I found I needed to use a jar opener to remove the lid for the first time; I guess that is good when you are receiving this via the post as it means there is less chance of the lid coming loose and spilling contents into the parcel rather than onto your clothes. I like the scent, which transfers well to laundry and leaves it smelling floral without being overly sweet. It would be worth sniffing in a shop before committing to a large pack however, as not all laundry scents are to everyone’s taste. The softness is fantastic, particularly noticeable after laundry has been dried outside, which normally makes it feel stiff. A bottle will cover up to 36 loads (4-5 Kg), you will only manage 16 larger, 6-7 Kg loads.

The product is highly concentrated, so comes in a smaller bottle that is itself recycled. Reduced packaging and transport costs. All very commendable. Just how concentrated the product is can be sensed from the fact that you can detect the scent before you even open the bottle. When you do, don't breath deeply (as I did), it's overpowering. However, in it's more dilute form (just half a cap per load), it does add a pleasant, slightly zesty aroma to your clothes. The scent will be a matter of taste, but we like it and our washing feels soft and pleasant (though we were already regular Comfort users). In this form the product represents good value for a quality product and for those who want to lessen their impact on the environment (albeit in the smallest of ways), there's something for you here, too.",False,0.9692,189,0.03165178535454408,0.3488372093023253,Fake

I never had a problem with how well Persil cleans, and this hasn’t changed; a machine load of baby clothes – together with stains - muslins and bedding came out spotless. With the addition of the Comfort Pure conditioner, the laundry was very soft and smelled lovely. It also performs well on general washing.

Homecare,Comfort Intense Fresh Sky Fabric Conditioner 38 Wash 570ml,4/27/2019,4,"Doesn't just soften and scent the wash, but the whole house smells fresh and clean!","I've not used a separate conditioner in years, because most washing products these days seem to do it all. I hadn't realised how much of a scent boost a separate fabric conditioner delivers, and how much it actually does soften the wash. The bottles - 6 of them, and not 8 as the ad states, come in a compact box and tbh, that itself could be used to deliver the products in, rather than having that placed in an Amazon box with more paper wrapping. All of the packaging, including the empty bottles, can be recycled. You don't waste any of the liquid, as the top of the bottle is well designed to minimise spillage and so that you can pour just what you need (half a capful is recommended, but I went with a little more), and not a gush of liquid from a large spout. I've had to dry indoors today due to the weather, and my whole house smells of this. I'm really impressed with this, and even for 6 bottles rather than the stated 8, this is good value for money. I also like that the small bottles mean that I can store them on a lower shelf for heavier items, rather than risking my under-sink shelving collapsing (yes, it's happened more than once!). Just don't squeeze the bottles hard, as they're made from recycled plastic and are a little flimsy-feeling.",False,0.8945,274,0.03169621160911654,0.6511627906976747,Fake

It retains the quality one expects from the well known makers and leaves clothes feeling soft and smelling fresh. The concept of ultra concentrate isn't new as I recall they did one years ago in a tetra type pack. But now maybe public are ready for this innovation. The container is made from recycled plastic which is fantastic and refillable. It is also recyclable but the sleeve isn't which is a disappointment. I'm hoping the refill packs are from a more cardboard style pack though and fully recyclable. I'm glad it has a dose counter as it seems so much less to use it would be easy to put in too much if it wasn't there. My other half and I have sensitive skin and this was fine for us to use. I found it hard to read the small print on the wrapper even with magnification glass. But I couldn't see anything to say if it was tested on animals or if any animal products used in the making. Although this is not a food product these are issues that are important for many. Whilst it provides details of the headquarter offices it doesn't actually say where its produced, I think this would be helpful to know as for many people myself included would prefer to buy products made in country of sale to reduce carbon footprint. I am a little torn about this product as if it was a washing powder or liquid and comfort softener combination I can't help thinking that cuts down packaging and carbon footprint further and can be better value.

Ive found some amazing vegan ice cream alternatives. Ocado sell a number of delicious ones. I also LOVE Tescos gluten and dairy free Cornettos However was super excited to try these, especially after all the amazing reviews. The tops are covered in nuts and chocolate, and the cone is thick and crispy. However none of these bits are quite enough to hide the awful taste of the ice cream. I cant even describe it as bland, as it had a flavour.... just an awful one. It was not creamy and ice cream like. It was like frozen whipped up soya milk that they removed the flavour from. I enjoyed eating the chocolate and nut part and the cone, and just cringed my way through the ice cream part. Cant understand all the rave reviews. The vegan Magnums however are spot on and delicious!!!",False,0.9901,177,0.016879297251286996,2.7857142857142856,Fake
